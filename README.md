__SpaceSim is an interactive spaceship simulator created in Processing.__ The simulation's background was generated with Perlin Noise and a sine wave. The spaceship's propulsion was created with a basic particle system. 

[The Nature of Code](http://natureofcode.com/book/) inspired this simulation. 

# Controls 
Left and Right Arrow Keys - Rotate the ship. 

"Z" - Move the ship forward.

# Bugs
When the user presses "Z" for the first time, the background shifts slightly to the left.
